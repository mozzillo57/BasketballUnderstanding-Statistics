# BasketballUnderstanding-Statistics
The project aims are to analyze the feasibility of an intelligent system capable of understanding the game of basketball and collect statistics through visual data. The main purposes will be to recognise the players, understanding their team membership and localizing them in the field. To achieve these goals we will test a subset of non-deep and deep algorithms seen in our lessons in order to finally understand their strengths and limitations performing our tasks.
